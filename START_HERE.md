## 💡 **INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS**

### **When They Ask: "What did you build?"**

> "I built Little Nona, a bedtime story generator with a grandmother's warmth. Unlike chapter-based approaches, it creates SHORT, complete stories perfect for bedtime. I used a 3-agent architecture with Storyteller, Judge, and Reviser, each optimized with different temperatures. The Gradio frontend provides a warm, cozy interface, and the modular backend follows industry best practices."

### **When They Ask: "How is it different?"**

> "Three main differentiators: First, SHORT complete stories instead of multi-chapter arcs - this solves the real bedtime problem where parents need a quick, complete story. Second, Grandma Nona's personality brings warmth and comfort, not generic AI voice. Third, similar character names (Emmy from Emma) create connection while maintaining story magic. The architecture is also different - I used specialized agents rather than a planner-executor pattern."

### **When They Ask: "Why this tech stack?"**

> "Gradio for rapid, professional UI development within the 2-3 hour constraint. Modular Python backend for clean separation and testability. Three agents with different temperatures (0.8 for creativity, 0.2 for consistency, 0.7 for balanced improvement) following the single-responsibility principle. This stack lets me focus on AI architecture quality rather than boilerplate."

### **When They Ask: "What would you add?"**

> "Three things: First, unit tests for helper functions and integration tests for agent interactions. Second, a caching layer using Redis for faster repeat requests. Third, database persistence with PostgreSQL for story history and user preferences. But for the assignment scope, I prioritized core functionality, clean architecture, and comprehensive documentation."
